I try to keep in shape by running and cross-country-skiing. Sometimes I run some intervals at the nearby
running track and wanted an easy way to calculate how fast I had to run a 400 meter lap in order to run
1 kilometer at a certain time.

Being inspired by Ray Wenderlich's "The iOS Apprentice Tutorials" I wrote this tiny app for the iphone.
